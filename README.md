This VBA Macro moves the image of a boat across a 10 by 10 grid, based on data for coordinates from Excel. It also plays animations when turning 45, -45 and 180 degrees.
Note: The Macro is named Module 1 and will need to be renamed before use. You will need to have the grid be based on shapes and rename the animation and image files accordingly. This is made for MS PowerPoint, but it is applicable across
all MS Office products that support Macros.
